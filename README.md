# FMXVertScrollBoxEtude
A program that displays VertScrollBox values and changes the Bottom Bound and Viewport.

The Vertical Scroll Box is essential for the repositioning of a screen displayed on a mobile device when the virtual keyboard appears. The virtual keyboard often obscures the input field, making it difficult for the user to complete the input process.

This application allows the user to experiment with Viewport and Bottom Bounds settings to see the effect they have on the user's display. Armed with this understanding, effective coding can be developed to shift the display appropriately when the virtual keyboard is displayed.
